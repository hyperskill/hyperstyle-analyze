    |**submissions_path**| Path to .csv file with `submissions`. |
    |**issues_type**| Type of issue to analyse (can be `raw_issue` or `qodana_issue`). |
    |**issues_path**| Path to .csv file with all issues list (classes and types). |
    |**submissions_issues_statistics_path**| Path to .csv file with submissions issues statistics. |

    **Optional arguments:**

After all preprocessing stages you will get some .scv files which you need for feather analysis.
